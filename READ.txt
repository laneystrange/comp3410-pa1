The first part of the program is the alter fibonacci code and it prompts a user to enter how many it wants to count to
and it also alerts them not to enter a number larger than 9 or else the prompt will repeat because of how the code is set
up. After you enter the number of numbers you wish to see as output the rest of the code, most of it that I needed atleast
runs and it out puts that same number of number never exceeding the limit of 9.

The second part of the program asks for two numbers that the user is to input, it alerts them that the multiplying one will
not work if the second part is negative (bug I forgot to fix and don't have time at this juncture). After it takes both
it one at a time prints out the word of what it is doing (Sum, Difference, and Product) and also prints the result of those
computations. It also for efficiency uses mainly addition, the same registers, and also a quick while loop to find the 
product. At the end of the program it also has an exiting string the prints thanking the person using the program.

The third part is simply one that adds all odd numbers between 1 and 15 together and prints the result of all these numbers
added up. To do this I used a similar while loop to the one in part two, but it stops after the counter is above 15. I 
was able to use only odd numbers merely by using the changing variable in a single register always added by 2 at the end
of each run of the loop.
