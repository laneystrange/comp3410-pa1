PART ONE
What I saw:
Enter the size of the array to print: 5
The Fibonacci numbers are:
1 1 2 3 5

How I tested:
I entered numbers that were greater than 9. I entered numbers that were 0 or less.

PART TWO
What I saw:
Hello. I am Nick Gordon. This program requests two integers.
It then does three calculations, and saves them to data.
It then prints those results.
Please enter integer one: 2
Please enter integer two: 3
Sum: 5
Diff: -1
Prod: 6
This was the program! Hope you have a good day!

How I tested:
I used various combinations of integers, including 0s, negatives, etc.

PART THREE
What I saw:
Sum: 64

How I tested: There's not an awful lot of testing to this one. It either works, or it doesn't.
